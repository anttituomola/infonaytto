# Info screen for our home

Every morning I check the weather before taking our kid to the kindergarten. Every morning my wife checks the timetable for trains. Every morning we both check our shared calendar.

That's why I decided to make a simple app for this, living inside of an old Android tablet sitting on a table on our hallway.

The app shows the current weather with live rain map, as well as our calendar and the next trains.
